Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simultaneous hand game where two players form one of three shapes: a closed fist for rock, a flat hand for paper, or two fingers extended for scissors. The rules are cyclical: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The game is a zero-sum, simultaneous game with outcomes of a win, loss, or a tie, which usually leads to a replayed round until a winner emerge
